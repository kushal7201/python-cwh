##### Operators in Python:
# Arithmetic Operator
# Assignment Operator
# Comparison Operator
# logical Operator
# Identity Operators 
# Membership Operators 
# Bitwise Operators


# # Arithmetic Operators:
# print("13+11 is: ",13+11)
# print("13-11 is: ",13-11)
# print("13*11 is: ",13*11)
# print("13/11 is: ",13/11)
# print("13//11 is: ",13//11)
# print("13%11 is: ",13%11)
# print("13**3 is: ",13**11)

# # Assignment Operators:
# x=7
# x+=43511
# x-=543
# x*=4542
# x/=24
# x%=7
# x//=4
# print(x)

# # Compsrison Operatior:
# x=11
# print(x==34)

# # Membership Operators:
# a=52
# b=24
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not a)

# Bitwise Operators:
# 0 -00
# 1 -01
# 2 -10
# 3 -11
print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3) # 'or' symbol
